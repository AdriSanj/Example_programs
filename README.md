# Example_programs
A few programs for practice. 

cc_analytics.py -> A program for visualize actual values of cryptocurrencies, like the bitcoin or the dogecoin.

mallado.py -> Program for visualize the elements of a 2D mesh by reading two archives .txt. First of them has the points in the mesh, and the second has the points that are included in every element. I put a mesh with triangle elements for a first example of visualization. This was a little part of a proyect in the subject "Programming in C++".
